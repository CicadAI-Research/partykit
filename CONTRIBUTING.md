## Prerequisites

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) must be installed. We also use [https://bun.sh/] for installing dependencies.

## Installation

- Running `bun install` in the components's root directory will install everything you need for development.

## Running Tests

- `npm test` will run the tests, and rerun them on every change.

## Building

- `npm run build` will build the CLI and libraries.
